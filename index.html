        <h1> WHO AM I? </h1><br>
        <p>I was born and raised in Michigan for about thirteen years after which I moved to California. I received a BA in Business Ecnomics from the University of California, Irvine. I went on to work at Goldman Sachs as Portfolio Reconciliation Analyst for a little over a year. I quit to pursue my masters in Applied Economics from Johns Hopkins University while also working on a startup with a few friends of mine. After a while I found myself becoming extremely fascinated with programming and decided to make the jump into the industry.</p>
        <br><p>I am a basketball enthusiast (probably one of the few clippers fans out there #clipnation) that not only watches and reads a lot of basketball but also plays. I am also a self proclaimed foodie with an excel sheet of restaurants spanning the globe. In my free time I like to travel and have been to four continents so far (10 plus countries). The list could go on here but it would not be doing me justice if I did not also state that I am a political junkie.</p>
